# Trybesmith

This project brings a medieval item store, in the form of a RESTful API, using Typescript.

It was developed through layers (Models, Service and Controllers), allowing basic operations on a given database: Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD).
Some endpoints were created that will read from and write to a database, using MySQL.
